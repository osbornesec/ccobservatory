Error Handling Tests for Claude Code Observatory Broadcast System

This module contains comprehensive error handling tests for the broadcast system,
implementing Tests 6.1-6.4 as specified in the Canon TDD methodology.

Tests implemented:
- Test 6.1: Broadcast handles WebSocket send errors
  - 6.1.1: ConnectionClosed exception during send
  - 6.1.2: ConnectionClosedOK exception during send  
  - 6.1.3: ConnectionClosedError exception during send
  
- Test 6.2: Broadcast handles JSON serialization errors
  - 6.2.1: JSON serialization errors with invalid data types
  
- Test 6.3: Broadcast handles network timeout errors
  - 6.3.1: Network timeout errors (asyncio.TimeoutError)
  - 6.3.2: OS-level network errors (OSError)
  
- Test 6.4: Broadcast recovers from partial failures
  - 6.4.1: Partial failures where some clients succeed and others fail

Additional tests:
- Test 6.5: Error logging verification
  - 6.5.1: Broadcast logs errors appropriately for debugging

All tests ensure that the broadcast system is robust in production environments
with unreliable network conditions and diverse client states.
