PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;         -- Balance performance/safety
PRAGMA cache_size = 50000;           -- 200MB cache
PRAGMA mmap_size = 536870912;        -- 512MB memory mapping

```

### **Specialized Indexes for Conversation Workloads**
- Primary conversation access: `(conversation_id, timestamp DESC)`
- Role-based filtering: `(role, timestamp DESC)`
- Tool usage analytics: `(tool_name, status, execution_time)`

- Partial indexes for common queries (user messages, successful tools)

### **Performance Monitoring Tables**
- `query_performance` - Query execution metrics
- `wal_metrics` - WAL size and checkpoint tracking
- `connection_metrics` - Connection performance data
- `system_health` - Health checks and alerts

## 📝 Usage Examples

### **Basic WAL Manager Usage**
```typescript
import { WALManager, ConversationWorkloadStrategy } from '@cco/database';
import { Database } from 'bun:sqlite';

const db = new Database('observatory.db');
const walManager = new WALManager(db, {
  config: {
    autocheckpointThreshold: 1000,
    enableAutoMaintenance: true
  },
  checkpointStrategy: new ConversationWorkloadStrategy()
});

// Automatic maintenance starts immediately
walManager.startAutomaticMaintenance();

// Manual operations
await walManager.performCheckpoint('FULL');
const health = await walManager.performHealthCheck();
const metrics = await walManager.getPerformanceMetrics();
```

### **WAL Connection with Pooling**
```typescript
import { createWALConnection } from '@cco/database';

const connection = createWALConnection({
  path: 'observatory.db',
  enableMetrics: true,
  readPoolSize: 10,
  walConfig: {
    autocheckpointThreshold: 1000,
    enableAutoMaintenance: true
  }
});

// Concurrent reads automatically use connection pool
const conversations = connection.query('SELECT * FROM conversations LIMIT 10');
const messages = connection.query('SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = ?', [1]);

// Writes use single connection with transaction support
connection.transaction((db) => {
  db.exec('INSERT INTO conversations (title) VALUES ("New Conversation")');
  db.exec('INSERT INTO messages (conversation_id, content) VALUES (1, "Hello")');
});
```
