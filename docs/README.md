## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Problem Statement**
Current Claude Code observability solutions rely on limited hook events that only capture tool usage, missing the complete conversation context that drives development decisions. Developers lack visibility into:
- Complete conversation flows
- AI reasoning and decision-making processes  
- Cross-project development patterns
- Team collaboration insights
- Performance optimization opportunities

### **Solution Overview**
Claude Code Observatory monitors `~/.claude/projects/` directory in real-time, parsing JSONL transcript files to provide:
- Complete conversation visibility
- Real-time monitoring across all projects
- Zero-configuration auto-discovery
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Team collaboration features

### **Key Benefits**
- **100% conversation capture rate** - See every interaction
- **Zero configuration** - Auto-discovers all Claude Code projects
- **Real-time insights** - Live monitoring and analytics
- **Team collaboration** - Share insights and learn from patterns
- **Performance optimization** - Identify bottlenecks and improvements
