# WebSocket Real-time Foundation Setup

## Overview

Created comprehensive test scenarios and initial file structure for WebSocket real-time foundation following Canon TDD methodology. This prepares the foundation for the next +2 points toward Week 1 completion.

## Files Created

### Test Structure
- **`backend/tests/test_websocket_foundation.py`** - Comprehensive test suite with 23 test scenarios
  - Connection Management (5 tests)
  - Message Broadcasting (5 tests) 
  - Real-time Integration (5 tests)
  - Error Handling & Recovery (5 tests)
  - Performance Requirements (3 tests)

### Module Structure
- **`backend/app/websocket/__init__.py`** - Module initialization
- **`backend/app/websocket/connection_manager.py`** - ConnectionManager class for tracking active connections
- **`backend/app/websocket/websocket_handler.py`** - FastAPI WebSocket endpoint and message routing

## Test Categories Added

### 1. Connection Management
- WebSocket endpoint accepts connections at /ws
- ConnectionManager tracks active connections properly
- Multiple concurrent connections handled correctly
- Disconnected clients removed from active connections list
- Connection health checks work properly

### 2. Message Broadcasting
- Conversation updates trigger WebSocket broadcasts
- Message format is JSON with type and data fields
- Only relevant clients receive specific updates
- Broadcast failures don't crash the system
- Message queuing works during high load

### 3. Real-time Integration
- File monitoring triggers WebSocket updates
- New conversations appear in real-time
- Message updates broadcast to connected clients
- WebSocket updates include conversation metadata
- Performance impact of broadcasts is minimal

### 4. Error Handling & Recovery
- WebSocket disconnections handled gracefully
- Connection failures don't affect other clients
- Invalid WebSocket messages rejected properly
- Server restart preserves WebSocket functionality
- Memory leaks don't occur with long-running connections

### 5. Performance Requirements
- WebSocket broadcast latency <50ms (95th percentile)
- Concurrent connection handling performance (50+ connections)
- Message throughput remains stable under load

## Canon TDD Implementation

The WebSocket foundation follows the established Canon TDD methodology:

1. **Test List Created** - All 23 test scenarios documented in test file
2. **Behavior-Focused Tests** - Tests specify WHAT the system should do, not HOW
3. **Module Structure** - Clean architecture with separation of concerns
4. **Test Fixtures** - Mock objects and helpers for WebSocket testing
5. **Performance Testing** - Benchmarking for <50ms latency SLA

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **File Monitoring** - WebSocket updates triggered by file system changes
- **Database Layer** - Integration with Supabase client for data operations
- **API Endpoints** - Consistent response format and error handling patterns

### Frontend Communication
- **Standard Message Format** - JSON with type and data fields
- **Real-time Updates** - Conversation and message change notifications
- **Connection Management** - Health checks and graceful disconnection handling

## Performance Requirements

- **Latency**: <50ms for WebSocket broadcasts (95th percentile)
- **Concurrency**: Support 50+ simultaneous connections
- **Throughput**: Stable message processing under high load
- **Integration**: <100ms file detection from monitoring system

## Next Steps

1. **Implement First Test** - "WebSocket endpoint accepts connections at /ws"
2. **Add WebSocket Route** - Register /ws endpoint in FastAPI application
3. **ConnectionManager Implementation** - Implement connection tracking methods
4. **Message Broadcasting** - Implement broadcast functionality
5. **Real-time Integration** - Connect with file monitoring system

## Files Updated

- **`notes/features/api-foundation-endpoints/tests/test-scenarios.md`**
  - Added WebSocket test scenarios (lines 81-114)
  - Updated progress summary (2/180 test scenarios)
  - Added Performance Requirements section
  - Added WebSocket test structure documentation

## Verification

✅ **Test Discovery**: 23 tests collected successfully  
✅ **Module Imports**: WebSocket modules import without errors  
✅ **Test Structure**: Follows established Canon TDD patterns  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive test scenarios documented

The WebSocket real-time foundation is now ready for Canon TDD implementation, following the same disciplined approach established for API endpoints.
