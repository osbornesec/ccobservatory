- **Success Criteria:** Complete file-to-database pipeline operational with data validation

### Sprint 2: Real-time Features (Days 4-7)
**Priority 1 - Live Dashboard**

#### Day 4-5: WebSocket Implementation
- **Objective:** Real-time conversation updates streaming to frontend
- **Deliverables:** WebSocket server, client integration, connection management

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies (Must Complete First)
1. **Supabase Configuration** - Required for all backend tests and database operations
2. **Environment Variables** - Required for backend-frontend integration
3. **Migration Application** - Required for data storage and processing

### Non-Blocking Work (Can Parallel Process)
1. **Frontend UI Components** - Can develop with mock data while backend integrates
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Can establish once core pipeline is operational  
3. **Documentation Updates** - Can update while development proceeds

## Quality Gates & Validation

### Continuous Quality Assurance
```bash
# Daily development workflow
make dev          # Start all services with hot reloading
make test-watch   # Continuous testing during development  
make lint         # Code quality validation before commits
make ci           # Full pipeline validation before merging
```
