   - **Resolution:** Configure Supabase project and inject keys via GitHub secrets
   - **Timeline:** First task in Week 2

### Priority 1 (Development Experience)
2. **Makefile Shell Compatibility**
   - **Impact:** `source` command breaks on POSIX shells (Alpine, Debian)

### Priority 2 (Security Hygiene)
3. **Frontend Dev Dependencies (8 CVEs)**
   - **Packages:** vite, rollup, eslint-plugin-svelte
   - **Severity:** Moderate (dev-only, not production impact)
   - **Resolution:** Run `npm audit fix --force` on dev dependencies
   - **Timeline:** 0.5 days

### Priority 3 (Monitoring)
4. **Performance Baseline Missing**
   - **Impact:** Cannot track performance regressions
   - **Resolution:** Run benchmark suite after Supabase configuration
   - **Timeline:** 1 day
