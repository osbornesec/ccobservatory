- **Project Name**: ccobservatory
- **Region**: us-east-2
- **Status**: Linked (âœ…)

### Migration Files Available
The following 5 migrations are ready to be pushed:

1. **001_initial_schema.sql** (8.3KB)
   - Core database schema with tables for conversations, messages, tools, etc.

2. **002_performance_indexes.sql** (8.8KB)
   - Performance optimization indexes for efficient querying

3. **003_security_policies.sql** (16KB)
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

4. **004_search_capabilities.sql** (17KB)
   - Full-text search functionality and GIN indexes

5. **005_analytics_views.sql** (18KB)
   - Analytics views and materialized views for insights

### Issue Encountered
The database password is incorrect or needs to be reset. The Supabase CLI is failing to authenticate with the remote database.

**Error**: `failed SASL auth (invalid SCRAM server-final-message received from server)`

### Required Actions

#### Option 1: Reset Database Password (Recommended)
1. Go to the Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/znznsjgqbnljgpffalwi/settings/database
2. Navigate to "Database" settings
3. Reset the database password
4. Use the new password to push migrations

#### Option 2: Use Database URL with Password
If you have the correct password, you can use:
```bash
supabase db push --db-url "postgresql://postgres.znznsjgqbnljgpffalwi:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
```

### Commands to Execute After Password Reset

1. **Push migrations to cloud**:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   supabase db push --linked
   ```

2. **Verify migrations were applied**:
   ```bash
   supabase migration list --linked
   ```

3. **Generate TypeScript types** (to confirm schema):
   ```bash
   supabase gen types typescript --project-id znznsjgqbnljgpffalwi
   ```

4. **Test database connection**:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset --linked --no-seed  # Optional: Test with dry run first
   ```

### Expected Results After Successful Push

1. All 5 migration files will be applied to the cloud database
2. Database schema will include:
   - Core tables: conversations, messages, tools, projects, etc.
   - Performance indexes for efficient querying
   - Security policies for data protection
   - Full-text search capabilities
   - Analytics views for insights

3. TypeScript types will show the complete schema structure
4. Database will be ready for integration testing

### Next Steps After Migration Push
1. Test database connectivity from the Python backend
2. Verify all tables and indexes are created correctly
3. Test RLS policies are working as expected
4. Run integration tests to ensure everything is functioning
5. Begin connecting the backend application to the cloud database

### Current Database State
The database is currently empty (no tables), as confirmed by the TypeScript generation showing only basic types without any custom tables.
