## Risk Management

### Go-Live Risks
- **Risk**: System performance degradation under production load
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive load testing and performance monitoring
  - **Contingency**: Immediate scaling and optimization procedures

- **Risk**: User adoption slower than expected
  - **Mitigation**: User training programs and change management
  - **Contingency**: Enhanced user support and training resources

- **Risk**: Integration failures with enterprise systems
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive integration testing and validation
  - **Contingency**: Manual workflows and alternative integration methods

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Support team overwhelmed by initial user requests
  - **Mitigation**: Support team scaling and knowledge base preparation
  - **Contingency**: Additional support resources and escalation procedures

- **Risk**: Unforeseen security incidents during launch
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive security testing and monitoring
  - **Contingency**: Incident response team activation and communication
