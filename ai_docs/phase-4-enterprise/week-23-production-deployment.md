## Risk Management

### Infrastructure Risks
- **Risk**: Kubernetes cluster failures affecting availability
  - **Mitigation**: Multi-zone cluster with auto-healing and backup clusters
  - **Contingency**: Rapid cluster rebuild and data restoration procedures

### Deployment Risks
- **Risk**: Failed deployments causing service disruption
  - **Mitigation**: Blue-green and canary deployment strategies with automated rollback
  - **Contingency**: Immediate rollback procedures and service restoration

### Data Risks
- **Risk**: Data loss or corruption in production
  - **Mitigation**: Automated backups, replication, and point-in-time recovery
  - **Contingency**: Disaster recovery procedures and data restoration testing
