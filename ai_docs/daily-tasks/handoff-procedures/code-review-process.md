# Code Review Process

## Overview
Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and ensuring consistency across the ccobservatory project. This document establishes comprehensive procedures for effective, efficient, and collaborative code review processes that support both quality and team development.

## Code Review Framework

### Review Objectives
1. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure code meets standards for functionality, performance, and maintainability
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Distribute technical knowledge across the team and mentor junior developers
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and architectural concerns
4. **Consistency**: Maintain coding standards, patterns, and architectural alignment
5. **Continuous Learning**: Foster learning opportunities and skill development for all team members

### Review Types
- **Feature Reviews**: New functionality and feature development
- **Bug Fix Reviews**: Defect resolution and hotfix validation
- **Refactoring Reviews**: Code improvement and technical debt reduction
- **Security Reviews**: Security-focused analysis and vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Reviews**: Performance optimization and scalability improvements
