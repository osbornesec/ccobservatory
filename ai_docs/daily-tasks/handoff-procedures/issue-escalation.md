# Issue Escalation Procedures

## Overview
This document establishes comprehensive issue escalation procedures for the ccobservatory project, ensuring that problems are addressed efficiently, with appropriate expertise, and within acceptable timeframes. These procedures provide clear escalation paths, communication protocols, and resolution frameworks for various types of issues.

## Escalation Framework

### Issue Classification System

#### Severity Levels
1. **Critical (P1)**: Complete system outage, data loss, security breach, or business-critical functionality failure
2. **High (P2)**: Major functionality impairment, significant performance degradation, or security vulnerability
3. **Medium (P3)**: Moderate functionality issues, minor performance issues, or usability concerns
4. **Low (P4)**: Cosmetic issues, documentation updates, or enhancement requests

#### Issue Categories
- **Technical Issues**: Code bugs, system failures, integration problems, performance issues
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerabilities, breaches, access control problems, compliance violations
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Server problems, network issues, deployment failures, capacity limitations
- **Process Issues**: Workflow problems, communication breakdowns, resource constraints
- **Business Issues**: Requirements clarification, scope changes, stakeholder conflicts
