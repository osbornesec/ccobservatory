# Phase Transition Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the structured procedures for transitioning between project phases in the ccobservatory project. Each phase transition represents a critical milestone requiring formal handoff processes, quality gates, and stakeholder approvals.

## Phase Transition Framework

### Transition Types
1. **Phase Completion Transition**: Moving from one phase to the next in sequence
2. **Emergency Transition**: Expedited transition due to critical business needs
3. **Rollback Transition**: Reverting to previous phase due to quality or risk issues
4. **Parallel Phase Transition**: Managing overlapping phases with dependencies

### Universal Transition Principles
- **Quality Gates**: All exit criteria must be met before phase transition
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Formal sign-off from designated authorities
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of transition risks
- **Documentation Handover**: Complete knowledge transfer with detailed documentation
- **Resource Transition**: Smooth handoff of team members and responsibilities
