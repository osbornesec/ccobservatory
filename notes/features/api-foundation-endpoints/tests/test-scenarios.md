# API Foundation Endpoints - Test Scenarios

## Conversations API Tests

### Basic CRUD Operations
- [ ] GET /api/conversations returns list of conversations
- [ ] GET /api/conversations returns empty list when no conversations exist
- [ ] GET /api/conversations/{id} returns conversation with messages
- [ ] GET /api/conversations/{id} returns 404 for non-existent conversation
- [ ] GET /api/conversations/{id} returns proper APIResponse wrapper format
- [ ] GET /api/conversations includes pagination parameters (skip, limit)
- [ ] GET /api/conversations respects pagination limits

### Data Validation & Types
- [ ] Conversations API returns ConversationData model format
- [ ] Conversations include all required fields (id, project, created_at, etc.)
- [ ] Messages are properly nested within conversation response
- [ ] API responses use APIResponse[T] wrapper consistently
- [ ] Invalid conversation ID format returns 422 validation error

### Error Handling
- [ ] Database connection failure returns 500 with proper error message
- [ ] Database timeout returns 503 with retry information
- [ ] Invalid query parameters return 422 with validation details
- [ ] Unauthenticated requests return 401 (if auth implemented)
- [ ] ProcessingError exceptions are properly caught and formatted

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] GET /api/conversations response time < 200ms for 100 conversations
- [ ] GET /api/conversations/{id} response time < 100ms
- [ ] Pagination works efficiently with large datasets (1000+ conversations)
- [ ] Database queries use proper indexing and optimization

## Projects API Tests

### Basic CRUD Operations
- [ ] GET /api/projects returns list of projects
- [ ] GET /api/projects returns empty list when no projects exist
- [ ] GET /api/projects/{id} returns project details
- [ ] GET /api/projects/{id} returns 404 for non-existent project
- [ ] GET /api/projects includes conversation count per project
- [ ] GET /api/projects supports filtering and sorting

### Data Relationships
- [ ] Projects API shows related conversations count
- [ ] Project details include metadata and statistics
- [ ] Project response includes created_at and updated_at timestamps
- [ ] Project ID validation works correctly

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid project ID format returns 422 validation error
- [ ] Database errors are properly handled and logged
- [ ] Missing projects return consistent 404 format
- [ ] API rate limiting works correctly (if implemented)

## API Router Integration Tests

### FastAPI Integration
- [ ] APIRouter properly registers with main FastAPI app
- [ ] Routes are accessible at /api prefix
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation generates correctly
- [ ] Swagger UI shows all endpoints with proper documentation
- [ ] CORS headers are properly set for frontend requests

### Dependency Injection
- [ ] Supabase client dependency injection works correctly
- [ ] Database connection pooling functions properly
- [ ] Error handling middleware catches all exceptions
- [ ] Logging middleware records API access properly

### Response Format Consistency
- [ ] All endpoints return APIResponse[T] wrapper format
- [ ] Success responses have consistent structure
- [ ] Error responses follow ProcessingError format
- [ ] HTTP status codes are appropriate for each scenario

## WebSocket Foundation Tests

### Connection Management
- [ ] WebSocket endpoint accepts connections at /ws
- [ ] ConnectionManager tracks active connections properly
- [ ] Multiple concurrent connections are handled correctly
- [ ] Disconnected clients are removed from active connections list
- [ ] Connection health checks work properly

### Message Broadcasting
- [ ] Conversation updates trigger WebSocket broadcasts
- [ ] Message format is JSON with type and data fields
- [ ] Only relevant clients receive specific updates
- [ ] Broadcast failures don't crash the system
- [ ] Message queuing works during high load

### Real-time Integration
- [ ] File monitoring triggers WebSocket updates
- [ ] New conversations appear in real-time
- [ ] Message updates broadcast to connected clients
- [ ] WebSocket updates include conversation metadata
- [ ] Performance impact of broadcasts is minimal

### Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] WebSocket disconnections are handled gracefully
- [ ] Connection failures don't affect other clients
- [ ] Invalid WebSocket messages are rejected properly
- [ ] Server restart preserves WebSocket functionality
- [ ] Memory leaks don't occur with long-running connections

## Security & Validation Tests

### Input Validation
- [ ] Path parameters are properly validated
- [ ] Query parameters have appropriate limits
- [ ] Request bodies are validated against schemas
- [ ] SQL injection attempts are prevented
- [ ] XSS attempts in responses are prevented

### Access Control (Future)
- [ ] API endpoints respect authentication when implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] CORS policy is properly configured
- [ ] Sensitive data is not exposed in responses

## Integration & E2E Tests

### Database Integration
- [ ] API endpoints work with real Supabase instance
- [ ] Database transactions are handled properly
- [ ] Connection pooling works under load
- [ ] Database migrations don't break API functionality

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] API responses are compatible with frontend expectations
- [ ] WebSocket messages match frontend message handlers
- [ ] CORS allows frontend requests from localhost:5173
- [ ] API documentation is accessible to frontend developers

### Performance & Load Tests
- [ ] API handles 100 concurrent requests without errors
- [ ] WebSocket supports 50+ simultaneous connections
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load
- [ ] Response times stay within SLA under typical load

## Development & Deployment Tests

### Code Quality
- [ ] All API code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Type hints are properly used throughout
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Code coverage meets 85% threshold for backend

### Build & CI Integration
- [ ] Tests pass in CI environment
- [ ] API endpoints work in Docker containers
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Health checks include API endpoint validation
