# Database Schema Implementation

## Feature Overview

Implementation of the core database schema for Claude Code Observatory using Supabase (PostgreSQL) with comprehensive migration scripts, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and performance optimizations.

## Design Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase for managed infrastructure and real-time subscriptions
- **Schema Management**: SQL migration files with semantic versioning
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- **Performance**: Specialized indexes and query optimization
- **Testing**: pytest with transaction rollback for isolation

### Key Features
1. **Core Tables**: projects, conversations, messages, tool_calls
2. **Performance Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
3. **RLS Policies**: Secure data access patterns
4. **Full-Text Search**: PostgreSQL native search capabilities
5. **Real-time Support**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions
6. **Analytics Support**: Materialized views and aggregation tables

### Schema Principles
- **Normalization**: 3NF with strategic denormalization for performance
- **Constraints**: Comprehensive data validation at database level
- **Indexing**: Performance-first index strategy
- **Scalability**: Designed for 10K+ conversations and 1M+ messages
- **Extensibility**: JSON fields for flexible metadata storage

## Test-Driven Development Approach

Following Canon TDD methodology:
1. **Test List**: Comprehensive scenario coverage (see tests/test-scenarios.md)
2. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for schema constraints and operations
3. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal migrations to pass tests
4. **Refactor Phase**: Optimize performance and add advanced features

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Core migration scripts (001-core-tables)
- [ ] Performance indexes (002-performance-indexes)
- [ ] RLS policies (003-security-policies)
- [ ] Full-text search setup (004-search-capabilities)
- [ ] Analytics views (005-analytics-views)
- [ ] Test infrastructure setup
- [ ] Performance validation tests
- [ ] Security policy tests

## Performance Requirements

- Query response time: < 100ms (95th percentile)
- Concurrent connections: 100+ simultaneous users
- Write throughput: 1000+ messages per second
- Storage capacity: Support for 10GB+ databases
- Full-text search: < 500ms for complex queries

## Security Requirements

- Row Level Security on all tables
- User-based data isolation
- API key rotation support
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Data encryption at rest (Supabase default)
