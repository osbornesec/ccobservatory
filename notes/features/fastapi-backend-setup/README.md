# FastAPI Backend Setup Feature

## Overview
This feature implements the foundational FastAPI backend application structure for Claude Code Observatory, following the Week 1 Environment Setup plan.

## Objectives
- Create FastAPI application instance with proper configuration
- Set up basic health check endpoints
- Configure CORS middleware for SvelteKit frontend integration
- Establish module structure for future components
- Implement testing infrastructure with pytest and TestClient

## Design Decisions
- **FastAPI Framework**: Chosen for high performance, automatic documentation, and excellent async support
- **Module Structure**: Organized by functionality (api, websocket, database, monitoring, analytics, auth)
- **Environment Configuration**: Using python-dotenv for flexible environment management
- **CORS Setup**: Pre-configured for local development with SvelteKit on port 5173
- **Testing Strategy**: Using FastAPI TestClient with pytest for comprehensive testing

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Python virtual environment set up
- [x] Dependencies installed and configured
- [x] Test scenarios documented
- [x] FastAPI application implementation (TDD completed)
- [x] Health check endpoints
- [x] CORS middleware configuration
- [x] Testing infrastructure setup
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Documentation validation

## Files Created
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Production dependencies
- `backend/requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies  
- `backend/pyproject.toml` - Python tool configuration
- `backend/app/__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI application with CORS middleware
- `backend/tests/test_main.py` - Comprehensive test suite (4 passing tests)
- Test scenarios and feature documentation
- Updated `.gitignore` - Python virtual environment exclusions

## Completed Implementation
âœ… FastAPI backend foundation successfully implemented using Canon TDD methodology:
- FastAPI application with proper configuration (title, description, version)
- CORS middleware configured for SvelteKit frontend integration (port 5173)
- Health check endpoints: `/` and `/health`
- Application factory pattern for clean configuration management
- Comprehensive test coverage with pytest and TestClient
- Code quality validation with black, flake8, and mypy
- All 4 test scenarios passing with proper type annotations

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to **Week 1 Task 2: Supabase Database Setup & Python Integration**
